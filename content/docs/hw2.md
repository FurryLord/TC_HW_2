<u>*Note:</u>
On some modern cars, instead of an ignition lock, there may be a button. The algorithm in this case is similar - press the button, making sure that the car keys are inside the car.*

#### 2. Adjusting the driver's seat

*At this stage, you need to adjust the driver's seat, steering wheel, and mirrors so that you are comfortable driving the car.*

**2.1. Seat adjustment**

2.1.1. Adjust the driver's seat so that your legs are bent when pressing the pedals all the way. You can do this using the longitudinal seat adjustment lever, which is located in front under the seat.


2.1.2. Adjust the headrest of the driver's seat so that your hands, bent at an angle of 120 degrees, reach the steering wheel. You can do this using the seat backrest inclination lever, which is located to the left of the seat.
